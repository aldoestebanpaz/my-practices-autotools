gettext-client-example

An example project using gettext for i18n and l10n.

To add gettext support to the project, you have to:

1. Add the AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION and AM_GNU_GETTEXT macro in configure.ac.
  AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION adds to the package’s pre-build script an invocation of
  ‘autopoint’. For everyone who checks out the source, this autopoint invocation
  will copy into the right place the gettext infrastructure files that have been
  omitted from the repository.
2. Add the LOCALEDIR definition for c-preprocessor in Makefile.am
3. Run 'gettextize' or 'gettextize --no-changelog' for copying into the package
  some files that are needed in every package internationalized through GNU gettext.
4. Create po/Makevars from the template po/Makevars.template.
5. List each source file with translatable strings in po/POTFILES.in. This file
  tells which files, among all program sources, have marked strings needing translation.
6. Copy the header file gettext.h from the /usr/share/gettext
  directory into your package. It is a convenience header file for conditional
  use of <libintl.h>, depending on the ENABLE_NLS macro. If ENABLE_NLS is set,
  it includes <libintl.h>; otherwise it defines no-op substitutes for the
  libintl.h functions. In other words it is a wrapper around <libintl.h> that
  implements the configure --disable-nls option that can be useful when small
  binaries are more important than features.
  In many GNU packages, there is a directory lib/ containing helper functions;
  gettext.h fits there. In other packages, it can go into the src directory.
7. Run `sh autogen.sh` in order to invoke autoreconf. This will run 'aclocal' to
  regenerate the aclocal.m4 file and run 'autoconf' to regenerate the configure
  file.
8. Run `make -C po/ update-po` or `make -C po/` or simply `make` to generate the
  .pot file.
9. Update the .pot file as needed.
9. Run for example `cd po/ && msginit --locale es.UTF-8 && msginit --locale pt.UTF-8`
  and put the email address of the maintainer.
10. If needed, change the charset from ASCII to UTF-8 in .po files.
11. Create the po/LINGUAS file and list the available translations.
  This file is for limiting the .po files that should be processed.

NOTE: Run `make -C po/ update-po` whenever you need to update the .pot and .po files.
NOTE: `locale -a’` can be used to output a list of all installed locales in the system.
