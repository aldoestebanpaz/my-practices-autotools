How to run

When a program looks up locale dependent values, it does this according to the
following environment variables, in priority order:

1. LANGUAGE
2. LC_ALL
3. LC_xxx, according to selected locale category: LC_CTYPE, LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME, LC_COLLATE, LC_MONETARY, LC_MESSAGES, ...
4. LANG

Variables whose value is set but is empty are ignored in this lookup.

Then you can run any of:
  ./tmp/bin/gettext-client-example
  LANGUAGE=en ./tmp/bin/gettext-client-example
  LANGUAGE=es ./tmp/bin/gettext-client-example
  LANGUAGE=pt ./tmp/bin/gettext-client-example
